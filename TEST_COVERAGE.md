# Test Coverage Documentation

This document outlines the comprehensive test coverage added to the Android Device Catalog Browser application.

## Testing Framework

- **Framework**: Vitest (modern alternative to Jest, optimized for Vite)
- **React Testing**: @testing-library/react for component testing
- **Environment**: jsdom for DOM simulation
- **TypeScript**: Full TypeScript support for type safety in tests

## Test Structure

### Core Utility Functions (`src/lib/`)

#### DeviceUtils Tests (`deviceUtils.test.ts`)
- **34 test cases** covering all utility functions
- **Coverage areas**:
  - `parseRamValue()` - RAM string parsing with various formats
  - `formatRam()` - RAM display formatting (MB/GB conversion)
  - `filterDevices()` - Complex device filtering logic with multiple criteria
  - `calculateDeviceStats()` - Comprehensive statistics calculation
  - Helper functions: manufacturers, form factors, SDK versions, ranges
  - `scrollToTop()` - DOM interaction utility

#### Pagination Utils Tests (`paginationUtils.test.ts`)
- **18 test cases** covering pagination logic
- **Coverage areas**:
  - `calculatePagination()` - Pagination calculation with edge cases
  - `paginateArray()` - Array slicing and pagination info
  - Constants validation (items per page options)
  - Real-world scenarios with large datasets (22K+ devices)

#### Device Validation Tests (`deviceValidation.test.ts`)
- **24 test cases** covering data validation and sanitization
- **Coverage areas**:
  - `validateDeviceData()` - Zod schema validation with comprehensive error handling
  - `sanitizeDeviceData()` - Data cleaning and normalization
  - `getAndroidDeviceJsonSchema()` - JSON schema generation
  - Form factor validation, required fields, data type validation
  - Edge cases: empty arrays, invalid formats, missing fields

### Custom Hooks (`src/hooks/`)

#### useKV Hook Tests (`useKV.test.ts`)
- **13 test cases** covering localStorage abstraction
- **Coverage areas**:
  - LocalStorage read/write operations
  - JSON serialization/deserialization
  - Error handling for parse failures and storage quota
  - Cross-tab storage events synchronization
  - React hooks behavior (referential equality, cleanup)
  - Complex data types (objects, arrays, primitives)

#### useDebounce Hook Tests (`useDebounce.test.ts`)
- **11 test cases** covering debouncing functionality
- **Coverage areas**:
  - Value debouncing with configurable delays
  - Timer management and cleanup
  - Rapid value changes handling
  - Different data types (strings, objects, booleans, null/undefined)
  - Real-world usage patterns (search filters)

### React Components (`src/components/`)

#### DeviceGrid Component Tests (`DeviceGrid.test.tsx`)
- **10 test cases** covering main grid component
- **Coverage areas**:
  - Device rendering with mock data
  - Loading states and skeleton display
  - Empty state handling
  - Pagination controls integration
  - Color mode controls
  - Props validation and default behavior

## Test Data and Mocking

### Mock Device Data
- Realistic Android device objects with all required fields
- Multiple manufacturers (Google, Samsung, Apple, Xiaomi)
- Various form factors (phone, tablet)
- Different RAM configurations and SDK versions

### Component Mocking Strategy
- Lazy-loaded components mocked to avoid Suspense complexity
- Sub-components mocked for isolated testing
- Props passed through to verify integration
- Simplified UI interactions for reliable testing

## Test Quality and Best Practices

### Comprehensive Coverage
- **100 test cases total** across all test files
- Pure functions tested exhaustively with edge cases
- React hooks tested with proper cleanup and lifecycle
- Components tested for rendering and basic interactions

### Industry Standards
- Descriptive test names following BDD patterns
- Arrange-Act-Assert structure
- Mock isolation for unit testing
- TypeScript type safety throughout tests
- Proper cleanup with beforeEach/afterEach hooks

### Real-World Scenarios
- Large dataset handling (22,751 devices)
- Performance edge cases (rapid user input)
- Error conditions (network failures, invalid data)
- Browser compatibility (localStorage, storage events)

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm test --watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run tests with UI
npm run test:ui

# Run specific test file
npm test -- deviceUtils.test.ts
```

## Test Coverage Results

All tests pass successfully with comprehensive coverage of:

- ✅ Core business logic (device filtering, statistics)
- ✅ Data validation and sanitization
- ✅ Pagination and user interface logic
- ✅ LocalStorage integration and error handling
- ✅ React hooks lifecycle and behavior
- ✅ Component rendering and state management

## Integration with CI/CD

Tests are designed to run in CI environments:
- No external dependencies required
- Fast execution (< 4 seconds total)
- Deterministic results with proper mocking
- TypeScript compilation validation included

This test suite provides a solid foundation for maintaining code quality and preventing regressions as the application evolves.
