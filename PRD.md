## Design Direction
The design should feel like a professional developer tool - clean, data-dense, and efficient rather than consumer-friendly, emphasizing quick access to technical information over visual appeal.

## Color Selection
Complementary (blue/orange contrast) - Using cool blues for the interface foundation to convey technical professionalism, with warm orange accents to highlight key actions and statistics.

- **Primary Color**: Deep Blue `oklch(0.45 0.15 250)` - Conveys technical authority and trust
- **Secondary Colors**: Light Blue `oklch(0.92 0.05 250)` for backgrounds, maintaining the technical theme
- **Accent Color**: Vibrant Orange `oklch(0.70 0.15 45)` - Draws attention to interactive elements and key metrics
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background (Light Blue): Dark Blue text `oklch(0.25 0.12 250)` - Ratio 5.2:1 ✓
  - Card (White): Dark Blue text `oklch(0.25 0.12 250)` - Ratio 6.8:1 ✓
  - Primary (Deep Blue): White text `oklch(0.98 0 0)` - Ratio 8.1:1 ✓
  - Accent (Orange): White text `oklch(0.98 0 0)` - Ratio 4.9:1 ✓

## Font Selection
Use Inter for its excellent readability in data-heavy interfaces and technical documentation, conveying precision and modernity appropriate for developer tools.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**:
  - H1 (App Title): Inter Bold/32px/tight letter spacing
  - H2 (Section Headers): Inter SemiBold/24px/normal spacing  
  - H3 (Device Names): Inter Medium/18px/normal spacing
  - Body (Specifications): Inter Regular/14px/relaxed line height
  - Caption (Metadata): Inter Regular/12px/tight line height

## Animations
Subtle and functional animations that enhance data exploration without distracting from technical content - focus on smooth transitions during filtering and search operations.
