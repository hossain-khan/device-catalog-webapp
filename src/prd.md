- **Accessibility-First**: Colors chosen for maximum contrast and colorblind accessibility using distinct hues across the spectrum
- **Semantic Color Mapping**: Each category uses oklch color space for perceptually uniform brightness and natural color relationships

#### Form Factor Colors
- **Phone**: Blue spectrum (oklch 0.45 0.15 220) - most common device type
- **Tablet**: Purple spectrum (oklch 0.45 0.15 280) - distinct from phones
- **TV**: Red-orange spectrum (oklch 0.45 0.15 15) - warm, attention-grabbing
- **Wearable**: Green spectrum (oklch 0.45 0.15 120) - natural, active feeling
- **Android Automotive**: Yellow-orange (oklch 0.45 0.15 60) - automotive industry association
- **Chromebook**: Cyan spectrum (oklch 0.45 0.15 180) - tech/productivity association
- **Google Play Games on PC**: Magenta (oklch 0.45 0.15 340) - gaming/entertainment association

#### Performance Tier Colors
- **Budget** (< 2GB RAM): Neutral warm tones
- **Mid-Range** (2-6GB RAM): Balanced color temperature
- **Premium** (6-12GB RAM): Cool, professional tones
- **Flagship** (> 12GB RAM): Rich, premium color saturation

#### Visual Hierarchy
- **Color Indicator Bar**: Top border of each device card shows primary category color
- **Background Tinting**: Subtle background color variations maintain readability while providing visual grouping
- **Interactive Elements**: Icons and badges use category-appropriate colors
- **Legend System**: Dynamic color legend adapts to current view and filtering

### User Experience Flow
